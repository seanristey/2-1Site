until\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUntil somebody finishes the main narrative, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we still don\u2019t know where the skip is\u2026 <em>hiding</em>, in the setting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is also correct.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell happened? It never screwed up like this before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs far as we can tell, the interaction between the item, along with the book and matching <em>electronic media</em> caused the anomaly. We never tested 826 with multiple formats of matching subject matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 God dammit. What now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suggest we send an expeditionary force to retrieve the item. However, because of the nature of the setting, only one Agent may be sent at a time. We sent a three-man team in and they exploded.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHowever, it has been found that we can retrieve inorganic items from the setting and keep them indefinitely within our world. While we do believe that they will degrade and vanish once the setting is closed, I believe that this gives us a\u2026 how does one say, cheat code, in winning back SCP-826.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 what kinds of \u2018inorganic items\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease come with me. We have some preparations to make.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Dr Django Bridge had offered to house the Bookends at his Site for a while. While Site-66 is labelled as a Bio-Site, it usually houses miscellaneous animate SCP objects that may or may not be organic. Of course, he did this with the expectation that the other Doctors would <em>keep their stuff out of his stuff</em>. And of course, everything always cocks up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not an Agent. Why do I have to-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have proven in the past to be an expert when it comes to the current circumstances of the item.\u201d said the ginger-headed research assistant.</p>\n<p>Bridge was being pulled down the hall by several Agents and Research Assistant Steve, towards the unused area of the Site.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t even make sense. What did you do to my site?!\u201d Bridge was irate.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m just reading from a script, my doc wants you to do it.\u201d They turned a corner and reached a door to a testing chamber.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what you people are <em>doing</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cErr sorry. Just take the instructions and backpack.\u201d And with that, a large backpack was hefted into Bridge\u2019s arms by an Agent, and the paper into his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Fine. Whatever. Okay. I\u2019ll do your fucking mission.\u201d</p>\n<p>As everyone else piled out, Bridge looked at the portal. A door of white light, opening to the unknown fuckup beyond. He took a deep breath, then a long sigh. Sure, he\u2019s messed up here and there. The cockup with the lizard and ticket, yes, that was a bad move. Taking photographs of Birth Worm wearing funny hats? Yes, okay, that\u2019s dumb. But what the HELL did he do to deserve this?</p>\n<p>Oh well. After several minutes of dread and reflection, he slung on the pack and stepped in.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cSo why is the guy who pulled the bullshit with the ticket going in to retrieve this skip?\u201d Agent Dodridge leaned against a wall, watching monitors watching Bridge.</p>\n<p>\u201cEh, it can\u2019t hurt. At best, everyone and everything comes back unharmed. At worst, he dies.\u201d Agent Lament shrugged. He sat at the desk and got comfortable.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but wouldn\u2019t one of us do better? This guy\u2019s a fucking\u2026 archivist? According to his file.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThrow him a bone. He\u2019ll appreciate it if he survives.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Bridge opened his eyes and looked around. A bedroom; a bed in one corner, computer\u2026 A TV and Super Nintendo sitting in the middle of the floor, that\u2019s a bit strange. Shrug. Stairs in the corner of the bedroom. What\u2026? Whatever.</p>\n<p>He descended the stairs, noticing a woman at a table. Okay. Seems non-hostile.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 hello?\u201d He tapped the woman on the shoulder. She turned and smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. All boys leave home someday. It said so on TV. Prof. Oak, next door, is looking for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He froze for a moment, staring at the woman, before running out the front door and looking around. A larger building to the left, empty fields to the right, a small fence before him, water beyond. He dropped the backpack and finally read the mission brief Steve gave him.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Bridge. Enclosed is a set of mission-appropriate equipment, a photograph of SCP-826, and a packed lunch. Please retrieve SCP-826 as soon as humanly possible, and do not allow the complete destruction of any of the provided items. If our theories are correct, if you reach a \u201cgame over\u201d, you will die.<br />\n- Agent Lament</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Inside the bag were six red and white spheres, numbered 1 through 6.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 My mission is a Pok\u00e9mon Red Nuzlocke with a hacked team. Fuck yes.\u201d He turned and started off north, sticking a foot into knee-height grass.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey wait! Don\u2019t go out!\u201d He stopped. He turned to see an old man with a lab coat making his way towards him. \u201cIt\u2019s unsafe!\u201d \u201cGo away-\u201d \u201cWild Pok\u00e9mon live in the tall grass! You need your own Pok\u00e9mon for your protection.\u201d \u201cI really don-\u201d \u201cI know!\u201d \u201cStop-\u201d \u201cHere, come with me!\u201d \u201cNo dammit-\u201d</p>\n<p>Oak dragged Bridge to his lab, next to a scowling kid. \u201cGramps! I\u2019m fed up with waiting!\u201d \u201cGary? Hm, let me think\u2026 Oh, that\u2019s right, I told you to come! Just wait! Here, Django\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Bridge ignored the script, tapping his foot impatiently. As soon as Oak was done talking, he turned to leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait Django! Lets check out our Pok\u00e9mon! Come on, I\u2019ll take you on!\u201d</p>\n<p>With a flash of light, a Charmander appeared before Bridge. He picked Ball #1 from his belt and -</p>\n<p>A flash of light; a flash of red; a huge, hulking <em>thing</em> appeared. A spine-sail down its back; its mouth filled with enormous, glowing, red teeth; sightless, eyeless face; unmoving mouth, laughing with many voices.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Oh my god.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201c\u2026 What the fuck.\u201d Dodridge breathed flatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the one we shot the lungs out of. In the game world it won\u2019t kill Bridge. I think. \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c&#8230; Really? REALLY?\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The thing laughed at Charmander, screaming in four distinct voices. Charmander shivered, then leapt and scratched it across the face.</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/scp-939\">SCP-939</a>\u2019s INTIMIDATE cut enemy CHARMANDER\u2019s ATTACK!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CHARMANDER\u2019s ATTACK fell!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CHARMANDER used SCRATCH!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>Telepathic game prompts.

What else has he got?!\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Three hours later, Bridge was strolling through Cerulean City, into the Pok\u00e9mon Center. Poking his head in every building, looking in every bookshelf, in every PC, there was no 826. He DID have the Boulder Badge though. <a href=\"/scp-615\">Sherman</a> took care of Brock.</p>\n<p>Entering the Gym, he tossed a ball into the pool. Three minutes later, he stepped out, <a href=\"/scp-075\">Bob</a> hopping behind. To the Nugget Bridge!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s enjoying this too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh, let him have his fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo look at him. These are <em>war crimes</em>. They <em>melted</em>.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Three more hours, and Bridge exited Celadon Gym, with <a href=\"/scp-359\">Lazerbeak</a> gliding close behind.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re kickass, Laze. How do you know Steel Wing? That\u2019s not around till Gen 2.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSCRAW!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is a horrible noise.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201cWhy do they listen to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, that thing doesn\u2019t even move until night. How\u2019d you even acquire any of these? Zero Seventy Five is a high, <em>high</em> risk Keter. The fuck\u2019s with these Doctors?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI honestly have no idea. Wasn\u2019t me who put the forms in. Steve rolled a bunch of dice and used the numbers to requisition for testing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 god damn it Steve.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Bridge exited Saffron Gym riding on <a href=\"/scp-940\">Pazuzu</a>\u2019s shoulders. The dried up, shuddering corpse shivered and twitched, ignored by Bridge and the rest of the fucknormous spider beast.</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome job Pazuzu. You fucking <em>decapitated</em> \u2018Zam with that last X-Scissor. I am in no way surprised that you\u2019re Dark-Bug type, hell, I\u2019m not even going to ask why your attacks are ahead of your time. Just keep kicking ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHhh-\u201d coughed the corpse. \u201cSh-K!-ssss\u201d shrieked the spider.</p>\n<p>They rode off to Route 19.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Goddamn. It ate the fucking mime.\u201d Dodridge sank into a seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cMISTER, Mime, to be completely accurate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up. Just shut up. I feel sick.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\u201c\u2026 I wonder\u2026\u201d Bridge leaned on Cinnabar Island\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Center\u2019s counter, waiting for the healing machine to finish. Blaine\u2019s Gym <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">is</span> was babies.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 fuckit.\u201d He grabbed his balls and headed outside, calling on <a href=\"/scp-359\">Lazerbeak</a> to fly him to Viridian. Reaching the Pok\u00e9mon Center, he headed north and saw a balding man laid out on the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cAhh, I\u2019ve had my coffee now and I feel great! Sure you can go through!

Listening. Glancing at local security feeds on his desktop.</p>\n<p>He quietly reached into his pocket, and placed a small, spherical object on his desk. Pressing a button, it grew to the size of an orange.</p>\n<p>For you see\u2026 He did, indeed, have a hacked team.

    "text": "\nrating:\u00a0+258+\u2013x\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that we can\u2019t close 826 until\u2026\u201d\n\u201cUntil somebody finishes the main narrative, yes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we still don\u2019t know where the skip is\u2026 hiding, in the setting.\u201d\n\u201cThat is also correct.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell happened? It never screwed up like this before.\u201d\n\u201cAs far as we can tell, the interaction between the item, along with the book and matching electronic media caused the anomaly. We never tested 826 with multiple formats of matching subject matter.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 God dammit. What now?\u201d\n\u201cI suggest we send an expeditionary force to retrieve the item. However, because of the nature of the setting, only one Agent may be sent at a time. We sent a three-man team in and they exploded.\u201d\n\u201cWhat.\u201d\n\u201cHowever, it has been found that we can retrieve inorganic items from the setting and keep them indefinitely within our world. While we do believe that they will degrade and vanish once the setting is closed, I believe that this gives us a\u2026 how does one say, cheat code, in winning back SCP-826.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 what kinds of \u2018inorganic items\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cPlease come with me. We have some preparations to make.\u201d\n\nDr Django Bridge had offered to house the Bookends at his Site for a while. While Site-66 is labelled as a Bio-Site, it usually houses miscellaneous animate SCP objects that may or may not be organic. Of course, he did this with the expectation that the other Doctors would keep their stuff out of his stuff. And of course, everything always cocks up.\n\u201cI\u2019m not an Agent. Why do I have to-\u201d\n\u201cYou have proven in the past to be an expert when it comes to the current circumstances of the item.\u201d said the ginger-headed research assistant.\nBridge was being pulled down the hall by several Agents and Research Assistant Steve, towards the unused area of the Site.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t even make sense. What did you do to my site?!\u201d Bridge was irate.\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m just reading from a script, my doc wants you to do it.\u201d They turned a corner and reached a door to a testing chamber.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what you people are doing.\u201d\n\u201cErr sorry. Just take the instructions and backpack.\u201d And with that, a large backpack was hefted into Bridge\u2019s arms by an Agent, and the paper into his hands.\n\u201c\u2026 Fine. Whatever. Okay. I\u2019ll do your fucking mission.\u201d\nAs everyone else piled out, Bridge looked at the portal. A door of white light, opening to the unknown fuckup beyond. He took a deep breath, then a long sigh. Sure, he\u2019s messed up here and there. The cockup with the lizard and ticket, yes, that was a bad move. Taking photographs of Birth Worm wearing funny hats? Yes, okay, that\u2019s dumb. But what the HELL did he do to deserve this?\nOh well. After several minutes of dread and reflection, he slung on the pack and stepped in.\n\n\u201cSo why is the guy who pulled the bullshit with the ticket going in to retrieve this skip?\u201d Agent Dodridge leaned against a wall, watching monitors watching Bridge.\n\u201cEh, it can\u2019t hurt. At best, everyone and everything comes back unharmed. At worst, he dies.\u201d Agent Lament shrugged. He sat at the desk and got comfortable.\n\u201cYeah, but wouldn\u2019t one of us do better? This guy\u2019s a fucking\u2026 archivist? According to his file.\u201d\n\u201cThrow him a bone. He\u2019ll appreciate it if he survives.\u201d\n\nBridge opened his eyes and looked around. A bedroom; a bed in one corner, computer\u2026 A TV and Super Nintendo sitting in the middle of the floor, that\u2019s a bit strange. Shrug. Stairs in the corner of the bedroom. What\u2026? Whatever.\nHe descended the stairs, noticing a woman at a table. Okay. Seems non-hostile.\n\u201c\u2026 hello?\u201d He tapped the woman on the shoulder. She turned and smiled.\n\u201cRight. All boys leave home someday. It said so on TV. Prof. Oak, next door, is looking for you.\u201d\nHe froze for a moment, staring at the woman, before running out the front door and looking around. A larger building to the left, empty fields to the right, a small fence before him, water beyond. He dropped the backpack and finally read the mission brief Steve gave him.\n\nDr. Bridge. Enclosed is a set of mission-appropriate equipment, a photograph of SCP-826, and a packed lunch. Please retrieve SCP-826 as soon as humanly possible, and do not allow the complete destruction of any of the provided items. If our theories are correct, if you reach a \u201cgame over\u201d, you will die.\n- Agent Lament\n\nInside the bag were six red and white spheres, numbered 1 through 6.\n\u201c\u2026 My mission is a Pok\u00e9mon Red Nuzlocke with a hacked team. Fuck yes.\u201d He turned and started off north, sticking a foot into knee-height grass.\n\u201cHey wait! Don\u2019t go out!\u201d He stopped. He turned to see an old man with a lab coat making his way towards him. \u201cIt\u2019s unsafe!\u201d \u201cGo away-\u201d \u201cWild Pok\u00e9mon live in the tall grass! You need your own Pok\u00e9mon for your protection.\u201d \u201cI really don-\u201d \u201cI know!\u201d \u201cStop-\u201d \u201cHere, come with me!\u201d \u201cNo dammit-\u201d\nOak dragged Bridge to his lab, next to a scowling kid. \u201cGramps! I\u2019m fed up with waiting!\u201d \u201cGary? Hm, let me think\u2026 Oh, that\u2019s right, I told you to come! Just wait! Here, Django\u2026\u201d\nBridge ignored the script, tapping his foot impatiently. As soon as Oak was done talking, he turned to leave.\n\u201cWait Django! Lets check out our Pok\u00e9mon! Come on, I\u2019ll take you on!\u201d\nWith a flash of light, a Charmander appeared before Bridge. He picked Ball #1 from his belt and -\nA flash of light; a flash of red; a huge, hulking thing appeared. A spine-sail down its back; its mouth filled with enormous, glowing, red teeth; sightless, eyeless face; unmoving mouth, laughing with many voices.\n\u201c\u2026 Oh my god.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 What the fuck.\u201d Dodridge breathed flatly.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the one we shot the lungs out of. In the game world it won\u2019t kill Bridge. I think. \u201d\n\u201c\u2026 Really? REALLY?\u201d\n\nThe thing laughed at Charmander, screaming in four distinct voices. Charmander shivered, then leapt and scratched it across the face.\n\n\nSCP-939\u2019s INTIMIDATE cut enemy CHARMANDER\u2019s ATTACK!\n\n\nCHARMANDER\u2019s ATTACK fell!\n\n\nCHARMANDER used SCRATCH!\n\n\nTelepathic game prompts. Time to make shit up.\n\u201cCrunch!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell that was violent.\u201d remarked Lament.\n\u201cWhat do you fucking expect? What else has he got?!\u201d\n\nThree hours later, Bridge was strolling through Cerulean City, into the Pok\u00e9mon Center. Poking his head in every building, looking in every bookshelf, in every PC, there was no 826. He DID have the Boulder Badge though. Sherman took care of Brock.\nEntering the Gym, he tossed a ball into the pool. Three minutes later, he stepped out, Bob hopping behind. To the Nugget Bridge!\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s enjoying this too much.\u201d\n\u201cEh, let him have his fun.\u201d\n\u201cNo look at him. These are war crimes. They melted.\u201d\n\nThree more hours, and Bridge exited Celadon Gym, with Lazerbeak gliding close behind.\n\u201cYou\u2019re kickass, Laze. How do you know Steel Wing? That\u2019s not around till Gen 2.\u201d\n\u201cSCRAW!\u201d\n\u201cThat is a horrible noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do they listen to him?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that thing doesn\u2019t even move until night. How\u2019d you even acquire any of these? Zero Seventy Five is a high, high risk Keter. The fuck\u2019s with these Doctors?\u201d\n\u201cI honestly have no idea. Wasn\u2019t me who put the forms in. Steve rolled a bunch of dice and used the numbers to requisition for testing.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 god damn it Steve.\u201d\n\nBridge exited Saffron Gym riding on Pazuzu\u2019s shoulders. The dried up, shuddering corpse shivered and twitched, ignored by Bridge and the rest of the fucknormous spider beast.\n\u201cAwesome job Pazuzu. You fucking decapitated \u2018Zam with that last X-Scissor. I am in no way surprised that you\u2019re Dark-Bug type, hell, I\u2019m not even going to ask why your attacks are ahead of your time. Just keep kicking ass.\u201d\n\u201cHhh-\u201d coughed the corpse. \u201cSh-K!-ssss\u201d shrieked the spider.\nThey rode off to Route 19.\n\n\u201c\u2026 Goddamn. It ate the fucking mime.\u201d Dodridge sank into a seat.\n\u201cMISTER, Mime, to be completely accurate.\u201d\n\u201cShut up. Just shut up. I feel sick.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 I wonder\u2026\u201d Bridge leaned on Cinnabar Island\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Center\u2019s counter, waiting for the healing machine to finish. Blaine\u2019s Gym is was babies.\n\u201c\u2026 fuckit.\u201d He grabbed his balls and headed outside, calling on Lazerbeak to fly him to Viridian. Reaching the Pok\u00e9mon Center, he headed north and saw a balding man laid out on the ground.\n\u201cAhh, I\u2019ve had my coffee now and I feel great! Sure you can go through!

WEEDLE was caught!\n\n\n\"Oh shi-\"\nThe man flickered and turned to look at Bridge; he was greasy, with a pointed, horrible grin; slick, rancid hair, the stench of death. He floated above the ground a bit, black ichor dripping onto the dirt, hissing and burning like so many nightmares.\n\u201c\u0362F\u0361\u0315i\u035c\u035e\u0315r\u0328\u0315\u0360s\u0322\u0360\u0338t,\u0334 \u0321\u0327\u0334y\u035co\u0336u\u0335\u0328 \u0341n\u0337\u0338e\u0334\u0337e\u0361\u035fd\u035f\u0335 \u035et\u0328o\u035e\u0321 \u0489w\u0336e\u034fa\u0328k\u0315e\u0489n\u031b \u035ft\u0340\u0321\u031bh\u0341e \u0362\u0360\u0328t\u0321\u0336a\u0489r\u035ege\u031bt\u0360 \u0337Pok\u0358\u0327\u00e9\u0360\u0338m\u0341\u035co\u035d\u035en\u0362\u0489.\u0360\u0337\u201d\u0328\u0321\n\u201c\u2026 Nope.\u201d\nLazerbeak flew Bridge the fuck out of there and back to Cinnabar Island. He made his way to the shoreline, tossed Welker into the water, and climbed on its shoulders.\nThey swam for a few minutes up and down the shoreline. Then\u2026 something appeared. Without warning, the skies darkened; a tall pillar of glitch code flourished into being in before Bridge and Welker.\n\n\nWild MISSINGNO. appeared!\n\n\nWELKER\u2019s INTIMIDATE cut enemy MISSINGNO.\u2019s ATTACK!\n\n\n\u201cRecontainment of Theta-Prime commencing.\u201d Bridge muttered with a grin as he hopped into the shallows. Welker began singing nursery rhymes, teeth glowing redder; the glitchmon itself began to glow with a harsh light.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck was that.\u201d Dodridge paled.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t expect it.\u201d Lament sighed, leaning an elbow on the desk.\n\u201c\u2026 How\u2026 no. He\u2019s fighting math. He intimidated math.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m checking the Foundnet to see if anything breached containment. Just settle down and let me look for 106.\u201d\n\nTwo hours later, Bridge exited the Viridian Gym, Johnny in tow. The city burned, small cracks forming in the sky, Glitchmon leaking through. Old Man was nowhere to be seen.\n\u201cFuel.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cFUEL.\u201d\n\u201cJohnny, return, stop whining.

Hasn\u2019t even moved.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally\u2026\u201d Bridge looked up to the huge building before him. Ten straight hours inside the game. He was tired, hungry, and had to piss. \u201cThe Pok\u00e9mon League. Thanks for owning Victory Road, Welker.\u201d\n\u201cThanks for owning Victory Road, Welker.\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you.\u201d\n\u201cBahahaa\u201d\n\u201cBahhahaha!\u201d\n\u201cOkay that was fucking creepy.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna incinerate that thing.\u201d Dodridge punched the table, staring at the screen.\n\u201cWhat, Welker?\u201d\n\u201cWHAT DO YOU THINK?\u201d\n\n\u201cWelcome to the Pok\u00e9mon League!\u201d A woman in glasses greeted Bridge past the doors and rest center. The room freezing, containing only a floating dock on a deep, deep pool. \u201cI am Lorelei of the Elite Four!\u201d\nBridge sighed, dropping a ball. It burst into light, the dock creaking under the Bob\u2019s insane weight.\n\u201cNo one can best me when it comes to icy Pok\u00e9mon!\u201d Lorelei laughed. \u201cFreezing moves are powerful! Your Pok\u00e9mon will be at my mercy when they are frozen solid! Hahaha! Are you ready?\u201d\n\u201cBob, use Acid.\u201d\n\n\nBOB used ACID!\n\n\nELITE FOUR LORELEI sent out DEWGONG!\n\n\nCritical hit! Enemy DEWGONG fainted!\n\n\nELITE FOUR LORELEI sent out CLOYSTER!\n\n\nCritical hit! Enemy CLOYSTER fainted!\n\n\nELITE FOUR LORELEI sent out SLOWBRO!\n\n\nCritical hit! Enemy SLOWBRO fainted!\n\n\nELITE FOUR LORELEI sent out JYNX!\n\n\nCritical hit! It\u2019s not very effective\u2026\n\n\nEnemy JYNX fainted!\n\n\nELITE FOUR LORELEI sent out LAPRAS!\n\n\nCritical hit! Enemy LAPRAS fainted!\n\n\nA Dewgong appeared with a flash and dove under the water. Bob followed suit, sinking through the docks. The water began to cloud; the docks began to creak. Soon, Dewgong floated to the surface and returned to its ball. Another flash of light, and a plop to the side as Cloyster clamped and dove in; soon, it returned to Lorelei in a red light.\nThe docks started sinking. Lorelei\u2019s Jynx fired silver Icebeams into the water and waves of telekinetic force battered the pool; neither Ice nor Psychic attacks could strike the irrationally agile snail. Soon the docks gave way under Jynx and it fell into the water. Another burst of red, then white, then red light, and Lorelei\u2019s Lapras fell through the rest of the sinking docks.\nBridge stretched and began walking, then running to the next door. In a last-second Indiana Jones maneuver, Bridge slid under the closing door to Bruno and returned Bob to its ball.\n\u201cSorry to give you the cold shoulder, but I have places to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill him.\u201d Dodridge\u2019s eye twitched.\nLament burst out laughing.\n\u201cStraight up murder him in his sleep.\u201d Twitch twitch.\n\u201cI\u2019m more annoyed at the choice of attacks. Zero Seven Five\u2019s caustic, not acidic.\u201d Lament mused.\n\u201cIs there a fucking difference?\u201d\n\u201cShh\u2026 shh. Leave the science to me, Jason. It\u2019s better that way.\u201d\n\n\"I am Bruno of the Elite Four!\u201d Shouted the shirtless man sitting in the middle of a room full of rocks and dirt. \u201cThrough rigorous training, people and Pok\u00e9mon can become stronger without limit.\u201d\nBridge dropped Sherman\u2019s ball. A burst of white light, a rustle of leaves, and a massive pile of kindling crowded his half of the arena.\n\u201cI've lived and trained with my Fighting Pok\u00e9mon! And that will never change!\u201d An Onix burst from the ground. Onix is Rock/Ground type.\n\u201cDjango! We will grind you down with our superior power! Hoo hah!\"\n\u201cSherman, Razor Leaf!\u201d Bridge commanded.\n\n\nSHERMAN used RAZOR LEAF! It\u2019s super effective!\n\n\nEnemy ONIX used HARDEN! Enemy ONIX's DEFENSE rose!\n\n\nSHERMAN used RAZOR LEAF! It\u2019s super effective! Enemy ONIX fainted!\n\n\nELITE FOUR BRUNO sent out HITMONCHAN!\n\n\nEnemy HITMONCHAN used FIRE PUNCH!\n\n\nIt\u2019s super effective!\n\n\nSHERMAN, that\u2019s enough, come back!\n\n\nGo! JOHNNY!\n\n\nJOHNNY used INFERNO!\n\n\nCritical hit! Enemy HITMONCHAN fainted!\n\n\nELITE FOUR BRUNO sent out HITMONLEE!\n\n\nEnemy HITMONLEE fainted!\n\n\nELITE FOUR BRUNO sent out ONIX!\n\n\nIt\u2019s not very effective\u2026\n\n\nEnemy ONIX fainted!\n\n\nELITE FOUR BRUNO sent out MACHAMP!\n\n\nThat\u2019s enough, return, JOHNNY! Go! LAZERBEAK!\n\n\nAs leaves cut rock, the perverted stone snake returned to its master. A misshapen boxer in pink shorts punched a burning hole into the Stick Blob, only to be incinerated by a wave not unlike a supernova. A blemmyes with stretchy legs and a second stone snake followed their friend into scorched oblivion. The Burning Man simply incinerated everything in what can only be described as excessive proactive retaliation.\nA flash of metal, and the thud of muscle on stone, and the final fighters graced the field with their presence. The metal hawk Lazerbeak took flight; Bruno\u2019s prized Machamp flexed and posed in defiance.\n\n\nLAZERBEAK flew up high!\n\n\nEnemy MACHAMP used FOCUS ENERGY! Enemy MACHAMP\u2019s getting pumped!\n\n\nLAZERBEAK used FLY!\n\n\nIt\u2019s super effective! Enemy MACHAMP fainted!\n\n\nWith a sound not unlike a car wreck, the robo-bird crashed into the Goro knockoff, throwing it across the arena.\n\"My job is done. Go face your next challenge.\" Bruno grunted as he turned away from Bridge.\n\u201cWell fuck you too. Come on Laze, let's kick the shit out of some old ladies.\u201d\n\u201cSCRAW!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even.\u201d Agent Dodridge slumped in a chair, having long since given up on this making any kind of sense.\n\u201cYeah, the entire world is fucked up. Probably has to do with the fact that it\u2019s drawing from current-generation move pools when designing the SCPok\u00e9mon\u2019s moves\u2026 Would explain why the Nine Forty can use X-Scissor and Four Five Seven can use Inferno, when the series hadn\u2019t yet introduced any of those moves.\u201d\nDodridge stared at Lament; Lament stared blankly back.\n\nBridge entered the next room and looked around; a graveyard, musty and filled with fog.\n\"I am Agatha of the Elite Four!\u201d An old lady cackled, sitting on a tombstone across from Bridge.\n\u201cOak's taken a lot of interest in you, child!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a child-\u201d \u201cThat old duff was once tough and handsome! That was decades ago!\u201d \u201cMeh.\u201d \u201cNow he just wants to fiddle with his Pok\u00e9dex! He's wrong! Pok\u00e9mon are for fighting!\u201d\nBridge quietly pulled a ball from his belt. He hated Gengar.\n\u201cDjango! I'll show you how a real trainer fights!\"\nThe lights darkened; a huge purple shadow thing with glowing red eyes crawled out from Bridge\u2019s shadow.\n\u201cPazuzu, I choose YOU!\u201d Bridge cried, throwing the ball into the air. A flash of light; Pazuzu appeared. A desiccated, thin, starved corpse, carried by huge, needle sharp spider legs covered with eyes.\n\n\nEnemy GENGAR used NIGHT SHADE!\n\n\nIt\u2019s not very effective\u2026\n\n\nPAZUZU used NIGHT SLASH!\n\n\nCritical hit! It\u2019s super effective! Enemy GENGAR fainted!\n\n\nELITE FOUR AGATHA sent out GOLBAT!\n\n\nEnemy GOLBAT used WING ATTACK!\n\n\nIt\u2019s super effective!\n\n\nPAZUZU used NIGHT SLASH!\n\n\nCritical hit! Enemy GOLBAT fainted!\n\n\nELITE FOUR AGATHA sent out ARBOK!\n\n\nPAZUZU used SUCKER PUNCH!\n\n\nEnemy ARBOK fainted!\n\n\nDark light blazed against Pazuzu, doing naught but annoy the hellish man-spider. It leapt into shadows, silently flanking Gengar and hacking it apart with gusto; sparks of violet light burned from Pazuzu\u2019s claws. A Golbat replaced the ghost; ambushing Pazuzu with a smack of its wings, the spider turned into another slash, hewing the horrible flying mouth cleanly in two. After a moment, a huge cobra reared its head behind Pazuzu, only to be thwarted by the corpse with a backhand.\n\n\nELITE FOUR AGATHA sent out HAUNTER!\n\n\nPAZUZU used SUCKER PUNCH! But it failed!\n\n\nEnemy HAUNTER used HYPNOSIS!\n\n\nPAZUZU fell asleep!\n\n\nEnemy HAUNTER used DREAM EATER!\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t affect PAZUZU\u2026 PAZUZU woke up!\n\n\nPAZUZU used NIGHT SLASH!\n\n\nCritical hit! It\u2019s super effective! Enemy HAUNTER fainted!\n\n\nELITE FOUR AGATHA sent out GENGAR!\n\n\nPAZUZU used SUCKER PUNCH!\n\n\nIt\u2019s super effective! Enemy GENGAR fainted!\n\n\nThere was a silence after the Golbat returned to Agatha. Pazuzu circled the field, expertly maneuvering the gravestones, before just slumping into sleep. The Haunter appeared, and tried to bite the corpses\u2019 head; it yelped in fright as the spider awoke and stabbed it into the wall, scrambling up into the dark. As the final Gengar appeared, Pazuzu dropped onto it, impaling the ghost with all eight legs.\n\"You win! I see what the old duff sees in you now. I've nothing else to say. Run along now, child!\"\n\n\u201cMother of God.\u201d\n\n\"Ah! I heard about you, DJANGO!\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, Lance the Dragon Trainer. Blah blah\u2026\u201d Bridge groaned. He looked around the penultimate room; huge statues of nondescript dragons adorned the walls, with brass torches hanging from the ceiling. As he took in the sight, an errant quote passed through his mind.\n\n\n\u2026During this transformation process, SCP-826, along with the contained book, will relocate to another part of the book's setting, showing a preference for places where books are normally found (libraries, studies, etc)\u2026\n\n\n\u201cPreference. Preference implies that this isn\u2019t a hard and fast rule, just the prevailing behavioural trend that a creative object will show in a particular situation during testing.\u201d Bridge murmured to himself; in a moment he caught a glimpse of silver-grey against the bronze walls behind Lance. The Bookends.\n\u201cYou know that dragons are mythical Pok\u00e9mon! They\u2019re hard to catch and raise, but their powers are superior! They\u2019re virtually indestructible! Well, are you ready to lose? Your League challenge ends with me, DJANGO!\u201d\nThe battle began.\n\n\nELITE FOUR LANCE sent out GYARADOS!\n\n\nGo! WELKER!\n\n\nEnemy GYARADOS\u2019s INTIMIDATE cut WELKER\u2019s ATTACK!\n\n\nWELKER\u2019s INTIMIDATE cut enemy GYARADOS\u2019s ATTACK!\n\n\nEnemy GYARADOS used HYPER BEAM!\n\n\nThe attack missed!\n\n\nWELKER used CRUNCH! Critical hit!\n\n\nEnemy GYARADOS used LEER!\n\n\nBut it failed!\n\n\nWELKER used THUNDER FANG!\n\n\nIt\u2019s super effective! Enemy GYARADOS fainted!\n\n\nThe 939 crawled over Gyarados, each of the monsters somehow scaring the others with their terrifying jaws. A rogue Hyper Beam crashed through the ceiling as Welker crunched down on Gyara\u2019s throat, delivering a bolt of lightning into the serpent; a stronger bolt followed shortly and the serpent fell.\n\n\nELITE FOUR LANCE sent out DRAGONAIR and DRAGONAIR!\n\n\nGood job WELKER! Come back! Go! PAZUZU and SHERMAN!\n\n\nEnemy DRAGONAIR used DRAGON RAGE! Enemy DRAGONAIR used DRAGON RAGE!\n\n\nPAZUZU used BOUNCE! SHERMAN used RAZOR LEAF! Critical hit!\n\n\nEnemy DRAGONAIR used AGILITY! Enemy DRAGONAIR used AGILITY!\n\n\nPAZUZU used BOUNCE! Critical hit! SHERMAN used LEAF TORNADO!\n\n\nEnemy DRAGONAIR used SLAM! Enemy DRAGONAIR used SLAM!\n\n\nPAZUZU used X-SCISSOR! SHERMAN used FRENZY PLANT! Critical hit!\n\n\nEnemy DRAGONAIR fainted! Enemy DRAGONAIR fainted!\n\n\nThe twin Dragonairs slithered out of the light, spitting blazing blue fire. Welker vanished, replaced by Pazuzu the horrid, twitching, choking corpse-spider-monster and Sherman the giant pile of sticks. Immediately, the marionette leapt out of the way and clung to the ceiling, and the Sherman cried out, shooting razor-sharp foliage in every direction. The Dragonairs, badly cut, slithered in unison, moving quicker and quicker into a pair of silvery blurs\u2026 until Pazuzu impaled both into the floor and Sherman ran them over like a runaway cyclone of conifers. In one last ditch effort, the serpents slammed their tails in unison against the spider and stack, before being diced and smashed to soup.\n\n\nELITE FOUR LANCE sent out AERODACTYL!\n\n\nGood work, PAZUZU and SHERMAN! Go! LAZERBEAK!\n\n\nEnemy AERODACTYL used BITE! It\u2019s not very effective\u2026\n\n\nLAZERBEAK used STEEL WING! It\u2019s super effective!\n\n\nEnemy AERODACTYL fainted!\n\n\nThe stone dino-ptero-dragon clashed with the bronze and steel hawk, biting down. Ouch. The hawk flapped its wings and cut Aerodactyl\u2019s head right off. What a let down.\n\n\nELITE FOUR LANCE sent out DRAGONITE!\n\n\nGood work, LAZERBEAK! Go! BOB!\n\n\nEnemy DRAGONITE used HYPER BEAM! Critical hit!\n\n\nBOB used ACID ARMOR!\n\n\nEnemy DRAGONITE must recharge!\n\n\nBOB used GIGA IMPACT!\n\n\nEnemy DRAGONITE fainted!\n\n\nA blazing, incredible blast of energy scoured the scene, cutting a trench across the floor - the snail didn\u2019t even notice. Instead, it busied itself with\u2026 sweating. The Dragonite fell to one knee, taking a breath, exhausted by its effort\u2026 until it was messily decapitated by the snail launching itself like a cannonball across the field, its whole weight and caustic slime liquefying the dragon\u2019s skull, Lance\u2019s skull, and burning a hole through the door beyond.\n\nAgent Dodridge sat there, expressionless, staring at the screen for several seconds. With an annoyed grunt he suddenly stood up and flipped the table.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go bang my hot wife. Debrief this loser. Smell ya later.\u201d he called to Lament.\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t get angry. It\u2019s not his fault Charizard\u2019s not a real dragon.\u201d\nDodridge turned and walked out, fists clenched. He never swept Lance like that. He always spent fifteen or twenty Max Revives on his team. It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not fair.\n\nDr Bridge looked down at the Bookends. Between them sat a copy of a Pok\u00e9mon Red Version game kart, and the Official Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue Strategy Guide. The mission says take it and leave\u2026 but he\u2019s so close to being the very best there ever was\u2026\nWelker pried the final doors open, and Bridge stepped inside. This room was much bigger on the inside, opening to the night sky; an actual stadium, a coliseum, stood before him, with one single figure under the lights.\n\"Hey! I was looking forward to seeing you, DJANGO! My rival should be strong to keep me sharp!\u201d\nQuietly, Bridge considered what the fastest route to victory would be.\n\u201c\u2026DJANGO! Do you know what that means? I'll tell you! I am the most powerful Trainer in the world!\"\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\nAgent Lament got comfortable, turned up the volume on the monitor, and cracked open a Coke. This was going to be good.\n\n\n\nCHAMPION GARY sent out PIDGEOT!\n\n\nGo! LAZERBEAK!\n\n\nEnemy PIDGEOT used WING ATTACK! It\u2019s not very effective\u2026\n\n\nLAZERBEAK used STEEL WING!\n\n\nEnemy PIDGEOT used WING ATTACK! It\u2019s not very effective\u2026\n\n\nLAZERBEAK used STEEL WING!\n\n\nEnemy PIDGEOT fainted!\n\n\nThe birds circled each other, dive-smashing each other with their wings; Lazerbeak landed one right in Pidgeot\u2019s face, shattering its beak and throwing it into the wall.\n\n\nCHAMPION GARY sent out ALAKAZAM!\n\n\nThat\u2019s enough, come back LAZERBEAK! Go! PAZUZU!\n\n\nPAZUZU used SUCKER PUNCH! It\u2019s super effective!\n\n\nEnemy ALAKAZAM fainted!\n\n\nPazuzu rushed the Alakazam as it readied a Psychic attack, running it through with three spear-legs and cutting it apart.\n\n\nCHAMPION GARY sent out RHYDON!\n\n\nReturn, PAZUZU! Go! SHERMAN!\n\n\nEnemy RHYDON used HORN DRILL!\n\n\nBut it failed\u2026\n\n\nSHERMAN used FRENZY PLANT! It\u2019s super effective!\n\n\nEnemy RHYDON fainted!\n\n\nRhydon charged forward, spinning death-horn shearing through Sherman to no avail. The sticks scattered for a brief moment, thrown by the horn\u2019s inertia; they rushed together and smooshed the dinobeast underneath the whole one-tonne heap.\n\n\nCHAMPION GARY sent out GYARADOS!\n\n\nSHERMAN must recharge!\n\n\nEnemy GYARADOS used HYDRO PUMP! It\u2019s not very effective\u2026\n\n\nSHERMAN, that\u2019s enough, come back! Go! BOB!\n\n\nBOB used GIGA IMPACT!\n\n\nEnemy GYARADOS fainted!\n\n\nThe sticks struggled to roll back together as the fucknormous sea serpent flooded the field with an incredible torrent of water. Swearing under his breath, Bridge called Sherman back to its ball and threw Bob into the water, waiting a moment for it to wake up and crash into through Gyarados\u2019 mouth entire body.\n\n\nCHAMPION GARY sent out EXEGGCUTOR!\n\n\nBOB must recharge!\n\n\nEnemy EXEGGCUTOR used STOMP!\n\n\nReturn, BOB! Go! JOHNNY!\n\n\nJOHNNY used INFERNO! It\u2019s super effective!\n\n\nEnemy EXEGGCUTOR fainted!\n\n\nBob lodged itself into the ground, leaving itself open for Exeggcutor to stomp it ineffectually. The tree checked its foot, assuming the snail was dead, before being completely, instantly incinerated by Johnny\u2019s pure raging hunger.\n\n\nCHAMPION GARY sent out CHARIZARD!\n\n\nJOHNNY, come back! Go! WELKER!\n\n\nWELKER\u2019s INTIMIDATE cut enemy CHARIZARD\u2019s ATTACK!\n\n\nEnemy CHARIZARD used FIRE BLAST! WELKER was burned!\n\n\nWELKER used THUNDER FANG! It\u2019s super effective! WELKER was hurt by its burn!\n\n\nEnemy CHARIZARD used SLASH! Critical hit!\n\n\nWELKER used CRUNCH!\n\n\nEnemy CHARIZARD fainted!\n\n\nThe Charizard and 939 stared each other down, the dragon shuddering upon its remembrance of their first battle. Welker began to sing nursery rhymes as Charizard froze in brief terror. A shudder turned to a growl, and recoil turned to rage; Gary\u2019s starter launched a huge five-pointed star of fire at Welker, crashing the red beast like a truck.\nOn fire, the Welker leapt at the dragon, crunching down with a mouth full of lightning. Charizard returned with a slash, hewing a side of flesh right off Welker; the burning demon returned with a predatory bite to crush the skull. Charizard fell.\n\"NO! That can't be! You beat my best-\u201d\nBridge returned Welker and turned to leave, snatching up 826 before the ingame script made him hit the \u201cThe End\u201d screen.\n\nDr Bridge stepped out of the doorway, holding a belt of SCPok\u00e9balls and the Bookends. Two Agents rushed in, one throwing the belt into a high-security storage container and the other carefully placing the Bookends on a cart. Agent Lament stood off to one side, waiting for him.\n\u201cExcellent work, Doctor.\u201d Agent Lament shook his hand. \u201cYou did very well.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Lament. How were the nicknames?\u201d\n\u201cGreat.\u201d\n\u201cAm I gonna turn into a spider monster?\u201d\n\u201cNope!\u201d\nThey high-fived.\n\nLater that night, Bridge sat back in his office, relaxing. Listening. Glancing at local security feeds on his desktop.\nHe quietly reached into his pocket, and placed a small, spherical object on his desk. Pressing a button, it grew to the size of an orange.\nFor you see\u2026 He did, indeed, have a hacked team. But nobody said he couldn\u2019t have a starter too.\n"
